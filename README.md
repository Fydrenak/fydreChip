# fydreChip
A chip 8 emulator written in C++ using SFML.

This is just a simple command-line-launched emulator. 
I wrote it to teach myself more about emulators so I can 
make something a bit more impressive in the future.

Example usage: ./fydrechip c8games/INVADERS
  -runs the ROM 'INVADERS' in the relative path of ./c8games
  
 A pack of public domain roms can be found at: 'http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html'.
